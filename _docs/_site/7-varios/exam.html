<h2 id="what-the-exam-machines-are-like">What the Exam Machines are like</h2>
<p>1x10 pointer: this is easy boot to root machine. There will be a lot of ports open similar to Metasploitable but look for the unique service in a unique port. This took me 10 mins.</p>

<p>2x20 pointer: These will be similar to HTB machines such as October, Popcorn, Shocker, Beep.</p>

<p>2x25 pointer: One is Buffer Overflow and the other is a slightly harder, rabbit holed filled machine. Maybe Giddy, Jeeves.</p>
