<h1 id="ssrf">SSRF</h1>
<p>Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker’s choosing.</p>

<p>In typical SSRF examples, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection back to itself, or to other web-based services within the organization’s infrastructure, or to external third-party systems.</p>
<h2 id="common-attacks">common attacks</h2>
<p><strong>SSRF attacks against the server itself</strong>
. This will typically involve supplying a URL with a hostname like 127.0.0.1 or localhost
 For example, consider a shopping application that lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. To provide the stock information, the application must query various back-end REST APIs, dependent on the product and store in question. The function is implemented by passing the URL to the relevant back-end API endpoint via a front-end HTTP request. So when a user views the stock status for an item, their browser makes a request like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This causes the server to make a request to the specified URL, retrieve the stock status, and return this to the user.</p>

<p>In this situation, an attacker can modify the request to specify a URL local to the server itself. For example:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here, the server will fetch the contents of the /admin URL and return it to the user.</p>

<p><strong>SSRF attacks against other back-end systems</strong></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://192.168.0.68/admin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>SSRF with blacklist-based input filters</strong>
 Some applications block input containing hostnames like 127.0.0.1 and localhost, or sensitive URLs like /admin. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using various techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using an alternative IP representation of 127.0.0.1, such as 2130706433, 017700000001, or 127.1.</li>
  <li>Registering your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use spoofed.burpcollaborator.net for this purpose.</li>
  <li>Obfuscating blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SSRF with whitelist-based input filters</strong>
 Some applications only allow input that matches, begins with, or contains, a whitelist of permitted values. In this situation, you can sometimes circumvent the filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character. For example: https://expected-host@evil-host.</li>
  <li>You can use the # character to indicate a URL fragment. For example: https://evil-host#expected-host.</li>
  <li>You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example: https://expected-host.evil-host.</li>
  <li>You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request.</li>
  <li>You can use combinations of these techniques together.
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Change the URL to http://username@stock.weliketoshop.net/ and observe that this is accepted, indicating that the URL parser supports embedded credentials.
Append a # to the username and observe that the URL is now rejected.
Double-URL encode the # to %2523 and observe the extremely suspicious "Internal Server Error" response, indicating that the server may have attempted to connect to "username".
Change the URL to http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos to access the admin interface and delete the target user.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bypassing SSRF filters via open redirection</strong>
 It is sometimes possible to circumvent any kind of filter-based defenses by exploiting an open redirection vulnerability.
 Provided the API used to make the back-end HTTP request supports redirections, you can construct a URL that satisfies the filter and results in a redirected request to the desired back-end target.
 For example, suppose the application contains an open redirection vulnerability in which the following URL:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&amp;path=http://evil-user.net

returns a redirection to:

http://evil-user.net
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can leverage the open redirection vulnerability to bypass the URL filter, and exploit the SSRF vulnerability as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://weliketoshop.net/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&amp;path=http://192.168.0.68/admin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>blind ssrf</strong>
Blind SSRF vulnerabilities arise when an application can be induced to issue a back-end HTTP request to a supplied URL, but the response from the back-end request is not returned in the application’s front-end response.</p>

<p>Blind SSRF is generally harder to exploit but can sometimes lead to full remote code execution on the server or other back-end components.</p>

<p>The most reliable way to detect blind SSRF vulnerabilities is using out-of-band (OAST) techniques. This involves attempting to trigger an HTTP request to an external system that you control, and monitoring for network interactions with that system.</p>
